      Harness is an IOC application layer for .Net, Silverlight, Asp.Net, OWIN, and the Windows Runtime.
      Harness is not a framework, Harness is what makes your frameworks work together.
      
      Harness.Owin brings Harness IOC to Owinmiddleware and the IAppBuilder.
      Includes a ready registered base class for middleware BaseMiddleware.
      Harness.Owin does not bundle any middleware or framework support (no WebApi).
      Harness.Web.WebApi adds WebApi support to your Owin project.
      Harness.Web.Signalr adds Signalr support to your Owin project.
