    <description>Harness is an IOC application layer for .Net, Silverlight, Asp.Net, OWIN, and the Windows Runtime.
      Harness is not a framework, Harness is what makes your frameworks work together.
      
      This package contains an Autofac based implementation of a Harness Service Locator and 
      Application Factory. It is the reference implementation of those types; 
      demonstrating the creation of a container that resolves IDependency based objects,
      standard Harness Conceptual Interfaces (IDispatch, IScope, IRequest, etc..), and 
      Common Service Locator compatible components.</description>
